### What I learned

One of the main lessons I learned in this project is how **CSS specificity** and the **order of declarations** affect the visibility of elements on the page. 

Initially, my modal appeared even though it had the `.hidden` class. This was because the `#modal` rule set `display: flex`, and the `.hidden` class with `display: none` wasn't specific enough to override it.

To fix this, I learned to **increase the specificity** of the CSS rule so that it properly hides the modal:

```css
#modal.hidden {
  display: none;
}
```
ðŸŽ¯
**Takeaway**: When debugging UI behavior, don't just check your JavaScript â€” always verify how your CSS rules are being applied and whether specificity or rule order is affecting the outcome.
